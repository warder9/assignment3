In this task, we created a custom ERC-20 token using Solidity and deployed it on a test blockchain. We followed these steps:

ERC-20 Token Creation:

Built an ERC-20 token contract named <University_name_your_Group_name> (e.g., UniversityGroupToken).
Set the initial supply to 2000 tokens.
The token was deployed to the contract creator's address.
Implemented Required Functions:

Transaction Logging: Added a function to log details of token transfers, including the sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp.
Timestamp Retrieval: Created a function to retrieve the timestamp of the most recent transaction in a human-readable format.
Sender & Receiver Address: Implemented functions to retrieve the sender's and receiver's addresses for any transaction.
Test and Deployment:

Tested the contract using Remix and Ganache locally.
Successfully deployed the contract on a public testnet (e.g., Goerli) using MetaMask to handle transactions.
Outcome
The ERC-20 token was successfully deployed with all required features and tested on a public testnet.
All the required functions to interact with the token and log transactions were implemented and verified.
